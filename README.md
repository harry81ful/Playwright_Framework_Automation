# Automation Excercise

## Framework and methodologies used

- Playwright

  - Playwright is used to develop the test suite as it provides balanced approach towards both UI and API testing
  - As playwright is a product of microsoft there is more support and documentation is ever evolving

- Behavioural Driven Development (BDD Enabled)
  - This methodology was chosen due to its language driven tests
  - The design and development around behavior a user expects
  - The test scenarios are easy to read for any novice and can be be combined with TDD methodolgy

## How to get latest code

- Prerequisites

  - Latest version VS code to be installed in the local environment (download from here and follow instruction specific to OS https://code.visualstudio.com/)
  - Github is installed (https://github.com/git-guides/install-git)
  - node.js is installed (https://nodejs.org/en/download)
  - once installed users can clone the repository

- Any user can can clone the repository from the github account from (https://github.com/harry81ful/PartsTrader_Automation)

  - click on code and copy the HTTPS link provided
  - Open VS code and open a terminal (cmd promt or bash)
  - execute command `git clone <repo link>` in desired folder on your local
  - make sure to choose branch as main for the latest code

## How to deploy it locally.

- Once the repository is cloned on to local users can easily install all dependencies by running command `npm install`
- if any error during installation dependencies can be installed independently using `npm install <dependency>`
- This will include Playwright framework and cucumber plugins among other things
- Make sure that the package.json and package-lock.json files are cloned and in root directory (this is where all the dependencies their version are stored)

## How to run the tests.

- Users can run the tests in multiple ways entire test suite

  - `npm run test` or `npm test` will run all the tests that in the feature folder and its corresponding step definitions for cucumber based tests
  - further `npx cucumber-js` will also run the same
  - `npx playwright test` will run all the tests with .spec.ts file which are written in playwright framework

- If user wants to particularly run a single feature file then

  - users can use command `npx cucumber-js src/test/features/<file_name>.feature`

- If user wants a more granular and specific features or scenario (this is not implemented for now)
  - Then users can make use of 'Tags'. Any feature or scenario can be tagged for example '@regression' or '@Smoke' or '@API' or '@UI'
  - Users can execute the command `npx cucumber-js --tags "@ui"` to run only feature that has '@ui' Tag

## Additional commands

- When a feature is written the corresponding steps definitions are required to developed
  - The step definitions can be generated by simply executing command `npm run test` (again this will execute the all the tests and missing step definitions are generated)
  - We can make use of `npx cucumber-js --dry-run` to generate step definitions for all feature files
  - Further we can came use of 'Tags' and providing single file path to generate step definitions
    Note: in feature file the steps need to be unique or it will not generate step definitions

## Additional comments

- The file path for the feature files and step definitions (structure) are configured. Any changes will result in failed tests
